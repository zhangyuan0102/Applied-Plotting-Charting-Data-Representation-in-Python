This requires a separate library to use in the Jupyter notebook called `ipympl`, and I've installed that for you here. Animation depends on this library because it provides a new backend for us, call the `widget` backend. Let's turn that on here."

Then these frames are all stacked together into a playable video.\n",

The animation object has a handy safe function, which allows you to write the animation to a file. This requires additional third party library such as FFMpeg which can take a bit to install and set up. But the result is that you can fairly easily export your animations directly from the Jupiter Web programming environment. \n",

We could plot the samples for the normal distribution in one, for a gamma distribution in another, and then maybe a couple of paramaterized distributions like the normal distribution with different levels of standard deviation. This would be a great way to practice the skills that you've learned in this module, as it would require that you manage multiple sub-plots within an animation using histograms. If you want to tackle that challenge, I'll put a link in the course shell to an optional practice notebook for you to look at."
