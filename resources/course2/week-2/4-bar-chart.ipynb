Now, we can center them with a given bar, using the align parameter, but it's a bit frustrating when you have to make multiple bars, and you have to calculate it yourself. And it's a pain to go through and add a new data series manually. And this gets worse, we actually have to manually iterate through and add in dates if we want them. Because otherwise we couldn't set the bar left location appropriately.\n",
