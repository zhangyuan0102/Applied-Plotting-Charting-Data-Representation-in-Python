In fact, if you're are following along in the JupyterLab notebook with this lecture why don't you just pause the video and run the `rec_gc` function we wrote earlier to explore what kind of artists the x axes object actually contains.\n",

    "And there we go, wonderfully readable dates in matplotlib. And when we're talking of text and readbility let me share two other insights, the first dealing with equations. Matplotlib has a fairly strong connection to LaTeX a type setting language used by mathematicians and scientists. This means that you can use a subset of LaTeX directly in your labels then matplotlib will render them as equations Here, for instance, we can set the title of the axes so that there's an x squared directly in it. We do this by escaping to LaTeX math mode with dollar signs. Note that this works regardless of whether you have LaTeX installed. But with a full LaTeX installation, you have significant control over text formatting.\n",

    "For the second insight, I want to talk about the size of the figure itself. Why are we looking at small postage stamp figures? Well, that depends on your screen size and resolution, but we can tell matplotlib that we want the figure to be a certain size by passing in parameters when we first make the figure. Here I'll specify it in inches, but there are various other dimension methods you can use."
