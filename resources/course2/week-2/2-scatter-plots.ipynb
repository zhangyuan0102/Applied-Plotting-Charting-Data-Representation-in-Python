    "Matplotlib actually has a number of useful plotting methods in the scripting layer which correspond to different kinds of plots we might want to use. We are not going to go through all of them here but we'll touch on a few of the major ones. Regardless, there are a few things to keep in mind which we learned in the previous lecture. \n",
    "1. First, pyplot is going to retrieve the current figure with the function `gcf` and then get the current axis with the function `gca`. Pyplot is keeping track of the axis objects for you. But don't forget that they're there and we can get them when we want to get them.\n",
    "2. Second, pyplot just mirrors the API of the `Axes` objects. So you can call the `plot` function against the pyplot module, and this is just calling the axis plot functions underneath.\n",
    "3. Finally, remember that the function declaration from most of the functions in matplotlib end with an open set of keyword arguments. There are a lot of different properties you can control through these keyword arguments, and you won't find them described for each function in the docs. That can be a bit frustrating because you end up having to learn from examples.\n",

For instance, a point has an x value and a y value and a color and a size. That's not the case here. This is where it's useful to have some knowledge of list comprehensions and lambdas as we talked about in the first course. Also important is the zip function and list unpacking. And because this is so common in the Python data science world, I'm going to take a brief aside and talk about that here.\n",
